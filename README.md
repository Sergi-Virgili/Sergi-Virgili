# 👋 Hey! I'm Sergi

🌍 Based in Barcelona · 💻 Building stuff with Java & Spring · ☁️ Playing with AWS  
I teach, I code, I break things... and (most of the time) I fix them.  

---

## 🚀 What I'm up to
- 🏗️ Creating backend projects with **Spring Boot** (sometimes too many 😅).  
- 👨‍🏫 Helping students and devs get better at **clean code & architecture**.  
- 🌱 Learning more about **DDD, testing, and scalable systems**.  
- 🎯 Goal: turn complex ideas into **simple, working software**.  

---

## 🛠️ My Toolbox
- **Code:** Java ☕ | JavaScript | TypeScript  
- **Frameworks:** Spring Boot | WebFlux | React | Next.js  
- **Cloud & Ops:** AWS | Docker | Terraform | GitHub Actions  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL | MySQL | MongoDB | Redis  

---

## ⚡ Fun Facts
- 🃏 Built a **Blackjack game** in Spring just for fun.  
- 🎮 Currently experimenting with a **Pokémon domain-driven app**.  
- 🧑‍💻 I believe **commits should tell stories** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`…).  
- ☕ Runs on coffee, tests, and good memes.
